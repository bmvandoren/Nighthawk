Nighthawk
=========

## Overview

Nighthawk is a machine learning model for acoustic monitoring of nocturnal bird migration. 

Nighthawk is trained on recordings of nocturnal flight calls (NFCs) from the Americas, with the greatest coverage in eastern North America. It processes mono-channel audio files in .wav format and returns detections in a tabular format (.csv and .txt). Nighthawk currently includes training data from 82 species, 18 families, and 4 orders of birds that vocalize during nocturnal migration.

Nighthawk runs in a Python environment. The underlying model was trained with [TensorFlow](tensorflow.org). 

For details on Nighthawk training and performance, see the following [paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.05.22.541336):

## Installation

We recommend installing and using Nighthawk in its own Python environment.
If you're new to Python environments, we suggest installing either
[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) or
[Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) and using
the [`conda`](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/stable/) program
that comes with them to manage your environments. For help choosing
between Anaconda and Miniconda, see
[here](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/stable/user-guide/install/download.html).

The following instructions assume that you're using `conda` to manage
your Python environments. If you're using anything else (such as `venv`,
for example), you'll need to modify the instructions accordingly.

On Windows, type the commands below in an Anaconda Prompt. Anaconda
Prompt is a program that comes with Anaconda and Miniconda. It is a
lot like the built-in Windows Command Prompt program, but it is
customized for Anaconda and Miniconda. Once you've installed Anaconda
or Miniconda, you can find the Anaconda Prompt program in your Windows
Start menu or by typing "Anaconda Prompt" in the search field of the
Windows taskbar. On macOS and Linux, type the commands below in a regular
terminal.

To install Nighthawk, first create a new Python environment named
`nighthawk-0.3.1` that uses Python 3.10:

    conda create -n nighthawk-0.3.1 python=3.10

Then activate the environment:

    conda activate nighthawk-0.3.1

and install the Nighthawk Python package and its dependencies:

    pip install nighthawk

Finally, if (and only if) you're installing on an Apple computer
with an Apple silicon (i.e. M1 or M2) processor, issue the following
command:

    conda list

to list all of the Python packages that are now installed in your
environment. If the list includes a package called `tensorflow`
and not a package called `tensorflow-macos`, then uninstall the
`tensorflow` package with:

    pip uninstall tensorflow

and install `tensorflow-macos` with:

    pip install tensorflow-macos

For more about `conda`, including additional `conda` commands, see its
[documentation](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/stable/).

### `tensorflow-metal` for Apple Silicon Macs

On Apple computers with Apple silicon (i.e. M1 or M2)
processors, installing the ``tensorflow-metal`` Python package
into your Nighthawk Python environment with:

    pip install tensorflow-metal

can accelerate Nighthawk considerably. Unfortunately, however,
version 1.1.0 of the ``tensorflow-metal`` package (the most recent
version as of this writing) also appears to leak memory and cause
Nighthawk to hang when processing large (e.g. full-night) audio files
on our test machine, an M2 Mac mini with 8 GB of memory. For this
reason the package is not installed with Nighthawk by default.
Feel free to install it yourself, however, and test it for your
particular situation.

## Command Line Usage

Once you've installed Nighthawk, the simplest way to run it is to invoke
the `nighthawk` program from the command line. At an Anaconda Prompt
(on Windows) or terminal (on macOS or Linux), first activate your
Nighthawk environment with:

    conda activate nighthawk-0.3.1

Then, to run the `nighthawk` program on an audio file, say `my_file.wav`:

    nighthawk my_file.wav

`nighthawk` will output detections to the file `my_file_detections.csv` in the
same directory as the input.

Adding the `--raven-output` flag will also export a `my_file_raven.txt` file
that can be read as a selection table by
[Raven Pro](https://ravensoundsoftware.com/software/raven-pro/):

    nighthawk my_file.wav --raven-output

Adding the `--audacity-output` flag will also export a `my_file_audacity.txt` file
that can be read as a label track by
[Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/):

    nighthawk my_file.wav --audacity-output

You can also specify more than one input file for `nighthawk` to process,
and specify relative or absolute file paths as well as just file names.

`nighthawk` has several command line arguments for configuring detection
parameters and controlling output. For full `nighthawk` help, including a
list of all command line arguments, run the command:

    nighthawk --help
  
to produce the output:

    usage: nighthawk [-h] [--hop-size HOP_SIZE] [--threshold THRESHOLD] [--ap-mask AP_MASK] [--merge-overlaps | --no-merge-overlaps] [--drop-uncertain | --no-drop-uncertain] [--calibration | --no-calibration]

## Use with Vesper
  
You can also use Nighthawk from Vesper, for example if you would like to
view and interact with spectrograms of its detections in Vesper clip albums.
For more on this see the
[Vesper documentation](https://vesper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html#how-do-i-use-nighthawk-with-vesper).
